    /*
    Your task is to design and implement a simplified online shopping system that focuses on key OOP concepts such as
    encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

Requirements:

    Classes:
        Create a class named Product to represent a generic product in the online shopping system. This class should have
        attributes such as product ID, name, price, and quantity. Implement subclasses for different types of products
         (e.g., Electronics, Clothing, Books) with specific attributes and behaviors unique to each category.
         You can add author or ISBN attribute to book, designer for clothing, and manufacturer for electronics. You are
         free to add some more attributes in accordance to your preferences.

    Encapsulation:
        Encapsulate the attributes of the Product class and its subclasses appropriately, using private access modifiers
        and providing public getter and setter methods where necessary.

    Inheritance:
        Utilize inheritance to create hierarchical relationships between product subclasses.
        For example, Electronics and Clothing can inherit common attributes and behaviors from the Product superclass.

    Polymorphism:
        Implement polymorphic behavior by overriding methods such as getDescription() in each subclass to provide
        category-specific details.

    Shopping Cart:
        Create a class named ShoppingCart to represent a user's shopping cart. This class should include methods to add
        products, calculate the total cost, and display the contents of the cart.

    User Interaction:
        Add main() method and simulate interactions with the online shopping system. Allow users to add products to their
         shopping cart, view product details, and total cost.
