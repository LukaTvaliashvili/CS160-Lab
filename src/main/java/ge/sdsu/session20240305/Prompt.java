    You are tasked with designing a simple inventory management system for a retail store.
    The system should allow the store to track products, manage inventory levels, and handle sales transactions.
    Your solution should make use of object-oriented programming concepts including classes, interfaces, and exceptions.

    Define a class for a Product with attributes: product ID, name, price, and quantity in stock.

    Implement an interface for InventoryManagement with methods: addProduct(), removeProduct(), and updateStock().

    Create classes for different types of products such as Electronics, Clothing, and Groceries that implement
    the InventoryManagement interface.

    Design an exception hierarchy to handle scenarios such as attempting to add a product with a duplicate ID,
    attempting to remove a product that does not exist, or attempting to update the stock of a product to a negative value.

    Write a main program that demonstrates the functionality of your inventory management system.

    This should include adding products to the inventory, removing products, updating stock levels,
    and handling any exceptions that may arise during these operations.

    /*
    You are tasked with designing a system for a library management software. The system should handle various
    functionalities such as adding, removing, and updating LibraryItems, as well as managing library members.
    Your solution should utilize object-oriented programming principles including classes, interfaces, and exceptions.

    Define a class for a Book with the following attributes: title, author, ISBN, and availability status.

    Implement a class for a LibraryMember with attributes: name, memberID, and list of borrowed LibraryItems.

    Create an interface for a LibraryItem with methods: checkOut() and checkIn().

    Implement classes for different types of LibraryItems such as Book, Vinyl, and Journal that implement the
    LibraryItem interface.

    Design an exception hierarchy to handle scenarios such as attempting to check out an unavailable item,
    attempting to check in an item that is not currently borrowed by the member, or invalid member ID.

    Write a main program that demonstrates the functionality of your library management system.

    This should include adding LibraryItems to the library, registering library members, checking out and checking in
    items, and handling any exceptions that may arise during these operations.
