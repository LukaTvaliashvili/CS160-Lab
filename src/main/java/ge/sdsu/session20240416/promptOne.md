**Problem: RPG Game**


Create a program for a RPG game where you can choose different types of characters, such as warriors, mages, and archers. Each character has unique abilities and attributes. Use inheritance to create a base class called `Character` with common attributes like name, health, and level. Then, create subclasses for each character type (`Warrior, Mage, Archer`) that inherit from the `Character` class.

Next, implement a map to store players and their corresponding characters. Create new characters and add them to the map. You should also be able to view the details of the characters, such as name, health, level, and specific abilities based on their character type.
