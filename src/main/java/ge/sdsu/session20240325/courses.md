You've been tasked with creating a system to manage a university's course offerings. The university offers courses across various departments, and it wants to keep track of them efficiently. Your system should allow to add courses, search for courses by department or course code, and display all the courses available in the university.

**Create a `Course` class**:
-   Each course should have attributes such as course code, title, department, instructor, and schedule.
-   Include appropriate constructors and getter methods.

**Create a `Catalog` class**:
-   This class should manage a collection of courses using generics and lists.
-   Include methods to add courses to the catalog, search for courses by department or course code, and display all courses in the catalog.
-   Ensure that the catalog avoids adding duplicate courses.

**In the `main` method**:    
-   Create an instance of the `Catalog` class.
-   Add several courses to the catalog across different departments.
-   Perform searches for courses by department and course code.
-   Display all the courses available in the catalog.

Write the Java code to implement this university course management system.
