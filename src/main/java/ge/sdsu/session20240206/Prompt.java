    /*
    Implement a library inventory management system using object-oriented programming. The system should allow
    librarians to manage different types of items in the library inventory, such as books and vinyls, each with its own
    unique properties and behaviors.

    Create a LibraryItem class to represent a generic library item. It should have properties such as Title and methods
    for checking in, checking out, updating details, and displaying details.

    Implement Book and Vinyl classes with properties such as ISBN for books and Duration for vinyls. Override appropriate
    methods in each subclass to implement item-specific behaviors.

    The LibraryManager class should allow librarians to add new items to the library inventory, remove existing items,
    update item details, and view the current inventory status.

    Ensure that the system provides clear feedback when adding, removing, updating, or viewing items in the inventory
    in a form of a printed message.
